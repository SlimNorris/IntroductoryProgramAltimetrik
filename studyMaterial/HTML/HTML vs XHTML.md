XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language, XHTML is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML, XHTML is supported by all major browsers. Since the fundamental format of XML is standardized, if you share or transmit XML across systems or platforms, either locally or over the internet, the recipient can still parse the data due to the standardized XML syntax.

XML is a markup language where all documents must be marked up correctly (be "well-formed").

XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and flexible to work with other data formats (such as XML). In addition, browsers ignore errors in HTML pages, and try to display the website even if it has some errors in the markup. So XHTML comes with a much stricter error handling.

The Most Important Differences from HTML:

- <!DOCTYPE> is mandatory
- The xmlns attribute in <html> is mandatory
- <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> are mandatory
- Elements must always be properly nested
- Elements must always be closed
- Elements must always be in lowercase
- Attribute names must always be in lowercase
- Attribute values must always be quoted
- Attribute minimization is forbidden
