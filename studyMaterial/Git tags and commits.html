Tagging
Like most VCSs, Git has the ability to tag specific points in a repository’s history as being important. Typically,
people use this functionality to mark release points (v1.0, v2.0 and so on). In this section, you’ll learn how to list
existing tags, how to create and delete tags, and what the different types of tags are.

Git commit
The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought
of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to. Prior to the execution of
git commit, The git add command is used to promote or 'stage' changes to the project that will be stored in a commit.
These two commands git commit and git add are two of the most frequently used.
